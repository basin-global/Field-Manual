# Nature's Core Benefits

The benefits nature provides are commonly referred to as environmental assets which are comprised of stocks and flows. Ecosystem services are the "flows" and ecosystem assets are the "stocks"  of those benefits.

The valuation of these stocks and flows is paramount for ecosystem protection and restoration. Serving as the basis for proper valuation, we conducted an exhaustive review of over 120 Ecosystem Services, Natural Capital, Land Cover, and Real Assets classification and valuation frameworks.

We have synthesized these diverse systems into what we call Nature's Core Benefits. &#x20;

Real assets in a nature framework? It's strategic. In a world of rules, we turn legal 'limitations' [into tools](https://dispatches.basin.global/the-tools-we-have) for sustainable impact. Laws aren't barriers; they're opportunities.

## Core Benefits Framework

The Core Benefits Framework identifies 14 "stocks" of ecosystems and 21 "flows" of ecological benefits.
