# Core Benefits Label

**All finance is climate finance.**&#x20;

**Is your investment “healthy”? Is your project “nutritious”?**

The Core Benefits Label is the deliverable from the August 2021 Climate Sprint which set out to answer "**How can we best value long-term co-benefits and ecosystem services when mobilizing climate finance?**"&#x20;

The Core Benefits Label offers a novel approach to valuing ecosystem services and co-benefits in climate finance. It was developed through a collaborative, rapid-development process aimed at providing clear, actionable insights for valuing long-term environmental and social benefits alongside traditional climate and financial goals. Inspired by nutrition labels, the Core Benefits Label helps investors and stakeholders identify and support climate projects with significant ecological and social impacts, enhancing transparency and evaluation for broader benefits beyond mere carbon reduction.
