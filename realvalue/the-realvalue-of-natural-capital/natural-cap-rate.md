# Natural Cap Rate

Capitalization Rates or Cap Rates are one of the most common tools for real estate valuation and comparison. The Natural Capitalization Rate is a similar metric but instead of focusing just on income it incorporates holistic ecological value.

**A Natural Capitalization Rate** expresses the relationship between the stocks and flows of ecological value. This indicator allows for comparison across polygons and ecosystems based on condition, intervention, and underlying real asset market values.&#x20;
