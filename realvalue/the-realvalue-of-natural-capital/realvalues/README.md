# RealValues

Based on the [Core Benefits Framework](broken-reference), **RealValues** are the **individual** stock and flow dollar values that comprise RealValue.

The RealValue methodology reveals two primary categories of values of the Core Benefits: Anthropocentric Values and Public Goods Values.

## Anthropocentric Values

These values include widely recognized forms such as a property's market value and income, commonly classified as real assets. These are often referred to as financial value and typically part of the Provisioning category of ecosystem services.

## Public Goods Values

These are historically considered positive externalities and encapsulate the common benefits that nature provides for free, customarily classified as ecosystem services. These are often referred to as economic values and typically part of the Regulation, Maintenance, or Cultural categories of ecosystem services.

## Core Benefits Reconciliation

While 21 Core Benefits were identified, when converted to RealValues based on Anthropocentric or Public Goods classification it takes them down to 18. The reason being is that three of the Core Benefits, Raw Materials, Food, and Energy, fall into the Land and Resource Utilization categories as those real property rights 'run with the land'.
