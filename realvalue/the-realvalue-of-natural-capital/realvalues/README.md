# RealValues

Based on the [Core Benefits Framework](broken-reference), **RealValues** are the **individual** stock and flow values that comprise RealValue.

The RealValue methodology reveals two primary categories of values of the Core Benefits: **Anthropocentric Values** and **Public Goods Values**.

## Anthropocentric Values

These values include widely recognized forms such as a property's market value and income, commonly classified as real assets. These can also be referred to as financial value. These are typically the “Provisioning” category of ecosystem services.

## Public Goods Values

These are historically considered positive externalities and encapsulate the common benefits that nature provides for free, customarily classified as ecosystem services. These can also be referred to as economic values.

## Core Benefits Reconcilation

While 21 Core Benefits were identified, when converted to RealValues based on Anthropocentric or Public Goods classification it takes them down to 18.  The reason being is three of the Core Benefits (Raw Materials, Food, Energy) fall into the Land and Resource Utilization categories.
