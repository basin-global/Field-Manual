# STOCKS Values

Stocks are currently and primarily Anthropocentric Value (financial). The stocks value is the "real world" price, cost, or value of a polygon (the underlying real asset). Stocks are expressed as the real asset dollar value at a point in time ($).

Depending on user perspective and the intent of the RealValuation, this value can be the price of a property, the cost of a project, or other types of value like insurable value or the market value. It can even be leasehold value or cost.

As common in investment real estate valuation using the Capitalization Approach, the Land Utilization and Resource Utilization Core Benefits flows give way to the underlying real asset value.

If we do our job right, the paradigm of stocks primarily being regarded as real assets and anthropocentric values could change to stocks being truly valued for their holistic value. Just as in investment real estate, the dynamic relationship of the stocks and flows expressed via Natural Cap Rate changes the value of the underlying asset.

As an example, if the average market natural cap rate of wetlands is 120% it begins to make all wetlands value be based on the cap rate, not the underlying land value.
