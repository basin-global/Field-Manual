# STOCKS Values

In the RealValue framework, the stocks value is the financial of the underlying real asset. It is the 'real world' price, cost, or value of a polygon. Stocks are expressed as the real asset dollar value at a point in time ($).

Depending on user perspective and the intent of the RealValuation, this value can be the price of a property, the cost of a project, or other types of value like insurable value or the market value. It can even be leasehold value or cost.

### Capitalization Approach

As common in investment real estate valuation using the capitalization approach to value, the Land Utilization and Resource Utilization Core Benefits flows give way to the underlying real asset value. _See:_ [_Natural Cap Rate_](../natural-cap-rate.md)

If we do our job right, the paradigm of stocks primarily being regarded as real assets and anthropocentric values could change to stocks being truly valued for their holistic value. Just as in investment real estate, the dynamic relationship of the stocks and flows expressed via Natural Cap Rate changes the value of the underlying asset.

As an example, if the average market natural cap rate of wetlands is 120% it begins to make all wetlands value be based on the cap rate, not the local land value.
