# The RealValue of Natural Capital

**The RealValue of Natural Capital expresses the relationship of ecological stocks and flows at a point in time based on ecosystem extent, characteristics, and condition, in a common language, dollars.**

Like it or not, all ecosystems fall within jurisdictional purview and are part of our collective economic, legal, and social systems. While real asset valuation focuses on the highest financial return and maximal productivity (profit), RealValue establishes the “higher and better use” of real assets. By accounting for the benefits nature provides and the value of natural capital, RealValue provides a compelling comparison how a “property” should be utilized.

## RealValue Composition&#x20;

RealValue is comprised of and calculated based on two main components: **Ecological Polygon** and **RealValues**.

## RealValue Expression

RealValue is expressed via two metrics and one indicator:

* **Stocks**: real asset dollar ($) value at a point in time (lump sum _metric_). The stocks value is the "real world" price, cost, or value of a polygon (the underlying real asset).
* **Flows**: annual economic and financial dollar ($/yr) values (annual _metric_). Economic values are referred to as Public Goods Values and financial values as Anthropocentric Values.
* **Natural Capitalization Rate**: expresses the relationship between the stocks and flows. This indicator allows for comparison across polygons and ecosystems based on condition, intervention, and underlying real asset market values. Formula: Flows dollar value divided by Stocks dollar value equals the Natural Cap Rate (_indicator_).

These metrics and indicator can be linked to any assortment of ecological metrics, variables, indicators and indices both quantitative and qualitative to assess overall ecosystem state, function, and health including biodiversity.

Before diving into the details of Ecological Polygons and RealValues, here are some [examples of RealValue and Natural Cap Rates](examples-of-realvalue.md).
