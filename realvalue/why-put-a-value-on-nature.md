# ⚡ Why put a Value on Nature?

The [Appendix](broken-reference) references thousands of sources as to why and how to value nature. &#x20;

These two quotes ground us in the _**why**_:



> "_**Only when the last tree has been cut down, the last fish been caught, and the last stream poisoned, will we realize we cannot eat money.**_"
>
> \- Osage saying, circa 1893



> "_**…by bringing economics and ecology together, we can help save the natural world at what may be the last minute – and in doing so, save ourselves.**_"
>
> \- Sir David Attenborough  \
> The Dasgupta Review: the Economics of Biodiversity 2021



The RealValue of Natural Capital expresses the value nature provides in a language everyone understands: dollars.
