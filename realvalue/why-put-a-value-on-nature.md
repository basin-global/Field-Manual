# Why put a Value on Nature?

The [Appendix](broken-reference) references thousands of pages as to "why" value nature. &#x20;

These two quotes ground us in the _**why**_:



> "_Only when the last tree has been cut down, the last fish been caught, and the last stream poisoned, will we realize we cannot eat money._"
>
> \- Osage saying, circa 1893



> "_…by bringing economics and ecology together, we can help save the natural world at what may be the last minute – and in doing so, save ourselves._"
>
> \- Sir David Attenborough  \
> The Dasgupta Review: the Economics of Biodiversity 2021
