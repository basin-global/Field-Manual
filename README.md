# 📕 The BASIN Field Manual

### BASIN protects, restores, and stewards nature and ecosystems in perpetuity.

The **BASIN Field Manual** is the central reference to all that is BASIN. It is our expression of the intertwined, entangled **relational value** of the ecological systems we inhabit**.** Herein lies what we hope will be a compass, or at least a map, for the path ahead.

***

## Two Rules

_**If**_ BASIN had two rules they would be:

### Embrace Complexity

Complex is not the same as complicated. Biodiversity, climate, carbon, water, nature, and beyond — economics, finance, politics, law, art, health, wealth, and **well-being** — are all interconnected.

### Stocks & Flows

Ecological economics and ecosystem accounting are based on the principles of stocks and flows. This aptly mirrors nature's basins that store and circulate life-sustaining water. BASIN's model is crafted on this very essence— protecting and stewarding the stocks and flows of Nature's Intrinsic Value.
