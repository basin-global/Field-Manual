# ⚡ The Value Gap

A value gap lies between the intrinsic value of nature and its instrumental value as perceived by society. This dichotomy is further illustrated by contrasting ecocentric and anthropocentric values. Consider the following reflections:

> _“**How can you buy or sell the sky, the warmth of the land? The idea is strange to us. If we do not own the freshness of the air and the sparkle of the water, how can you buy them from us?**”_&#x20;
>
> \-1854, Chief Seattle to the US Government

> _“**Buy land, they're not making it anymore.**”_&#x20;
>
> \-Mark Twain

The BASIN Protocol bridges this relational value gap.
