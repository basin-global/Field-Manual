## BASIN Protocol

<details>

<summary>What chain is BASIN on?</summary>

Our main .basin (ERC-721) contract is on Polygon.  However the ERC-6551 Tokenbound contract and .basin 0x accounts are the same across all EVM's. Our main STREAMS (ERC-1155) contract is on Polygon as well but we are working on cross-chain implementation for this also.
