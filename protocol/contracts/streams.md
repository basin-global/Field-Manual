# STREAMS

STREAMS are the flows of value between BASIN's.&#x20;

As ERC-1155 contracts, STREAMS are semi-fungible and represent the unique and expansive value of each token type, but are also 1:1 certificates of the BASIN PROTOCOL. As more than just tokens, BASIN STREAMS flow financial and other forms of value from protocol activity through .basinâ€™s based on quantity of STREAMS held.

### Emergent Streams

'Emergent Streams' is our inaugural flow contract, offering limited editions exclusively for our early supporters and initial .basin members.

### nature hyperstructure

This is a collective art experiment on Zora with all proceeds going directly into .basin's via [FLOWS](flows.md).
