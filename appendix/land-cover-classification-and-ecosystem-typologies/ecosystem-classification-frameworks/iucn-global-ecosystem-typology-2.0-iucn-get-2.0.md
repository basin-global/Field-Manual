# IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology 2.0 (IUCN GET 2.0)

The [IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology 2.0](https://global-ecosystems.org/) offers a structured classification system that categorizes ecosystems based on their ecological functions and species assemblages. BASIN honed in on Levels 2 and 3, the system identifies "Functional Biomes" and "Ecosystem Functional Groups" as critical components within broader realms like terrestrial, freshwater, and marine. Functional Biomes share major ecological drivers that regulate key functions, while Ecosystem Functional Groups within these biomes share common drivers that lead to similar biotic traits. This hierarchical framework is essential for understanding the traits and drivers that underlie ecosystem functionality, thus aiding in ecosystem management and conservation efforts. This classification is crucial given the human influence on ecosystems, many of which are at risk of collapse, impacting biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human well-being.
