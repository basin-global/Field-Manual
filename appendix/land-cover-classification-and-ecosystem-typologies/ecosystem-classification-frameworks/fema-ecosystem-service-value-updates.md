# FEMA Ecosystem Service Value Updates

Original Publication: [June 2022 ](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema\_ecosystem-service-value-updates\_2022.pdf)

FEMA has updated its approach to hazard mitigation by incorporating Ecosystem Service Values (ESV) into its Benefit-Cost Analysis (BCA) Toolkit, measured in terms of dollars per acre per year ($/ac/yr). These updates extend across nine different land cover and ecosystem types and 14 categories of ecosystem services. The inclusion of ESV not only makes the toolkit more comprehensive but also simplifies the application process for subapplicants seeking to implement Nature-Based Solutions (NBS). Recent policy changes have expanded eligible NBS activities and eliminated previous benefit-cost ratio requirements, making it easier for projects focused on ecological benefits to receive funding. This marks a shift towards more sustainable and equitable hazard mitigation strategies.
