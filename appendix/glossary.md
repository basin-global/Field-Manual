### Aave&#x20;

Aave is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol operating on Ethereum that enables users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on cryptocurrencies. It eliminates traditional financial intermediaries, allowing users to deposit assets into liquidity pools for lending and borrowers to access loans with collateral. Aave has introduced innovations like flash loans and employs its native cryptocurrency, AAVE, for governance and collateral. It plays a key role in the growth of DeFi by providing efficient and accessible cryptocurrency lending and borrowing services.&#x20;

### Adaptive Capacity&#x20;

Adaptive capacity refers to the ability of societies, ecosystems, and individuals to respond effectively to the impacts of environmental changes, including those related to climate change and biodiversity loss. In the context of IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) and IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), adaptive capacity is a crucial concept for assessing and addressing the challenges posed by environmental changes. &#x20;

### Additionality&#x20;

Additionality is a fundamental concept in environmental and conservation contexts, serving as a criterion to assess the true impact of initiatives and projects. In the realm of carbon offsetting, it scrutinizes whether emission reductions or removals achieved are genuinely additional to what would have naturally occurred or been legally required, ensuring the legitimacy of carbon credits. Similarly, in biodiversity conservation, it evaluates whether conservation actions result in a net increase in biodiversity compared to a no-intervention scenario, safeguarding the integrity of conservation efforts. Conservation finance also relies on additionality to confirm that investments lead to heightened conservation activities beyond the status quo. This concept plays a pivotal role in verifying the effectiveness of environmental endeavors, preventing double-counting of benefits, and directing resources toward meaningful solutions to environmental challenges. &#x20;

### Area of influence&#x20;

The project area of influence is generally larger than the physical footprint of the project, and includes the area within which a project may potentially directly, indirectly, and cumulatively cause impacts to nature. _TNFD; IFC_&#x20;

### Atmosphere&#x20;

Atmosphere includes the gaseous medium and its suspended particulate liquids and solids above the land realm, extending to the altitudinal limits of life. _TNFD_

### basinDAO&#x20;

After the Core Benefits Label Climate Sprint in the fall 2021, a small group formed a DAO called CMPND. CMPND was established to apply the CBL to assessing and developing climate projects as a venture studio. Realizing this was too general, CMPND was renamed basinDAO. basinDAO was the first iteration of what is now the BASIN Protocol. While we no longer use the term DAO, BASIN is similar to a DAO in that it is a polycentric organization operated by its members.

### Biocredit&#x20;

a concept used to quantify and trade the ecological benefits or credits generated by conservation projects or initiatives aimed at preserving biodiversity and ecosystem services. These credits represent the positive impacts of such projects on biodiversity, habitat protection, or ecosystem restoration. Biocredits can be bought and sold as a mechanism to support conservation efforts, similar to carbon credits in the context of carbon offsetting. They encourage investment in conservation and sustainable land management practices, helping to safeguard biodiversity and promote ecological sustainability.&#x20;

### Biodiversity&#x20;

The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) definition is: "The variability among living organisms from all sources, including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems." BASIN emphasizes that this definition includes not just the diversity within and between species, but also extends to the diverse ecological roles and interactions within the ecosystems, incorporating both biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) components. BASIN places particular emphasis on the ecosystems themselves and the complex interrelationships, recognizing that organisms and species cannot exist in isolation from the ecosystems and habitat that sustain them. _TNFD; BASIN_&#x20;

### Biodiversity Credit&#x20;

A biodiversity credit is a tradable unit representing a quantifiable and verified conservation or enhancement of biodiversity in a specific area. Biodiversity credits are part of market-based mechanisms designed to promote biodiversity conservation and offset the negative impacts of development or land use changes. These credits are generated through activities such as habitat restoration, species protection, or land preservation and can be bought and sold to compensate for biodiversity losses in other locations, providing a financial incentive for conservation efforts. Biodiversity credits aim to balance economic development with biodiversity preservation and are often used in regulatory frameworks like biodiversity offset programs.&#x20;

### Biodiversity Net Gain&#x20;

a conservation approach and policy framework applied to development and land-use planning. This concept mandates that development projects must not only avoid harming biodiversity but also result in a quantifiable increase in biodiversity and habitat quality compared to the pre-development state. Under this principle, developers and landowners are required to assess the biodiversity value of a site before commencing any development activities. Subsequently, they must implement measures to enhance or restore biodiversity, often through activities such as habitat creation and native vegetation planting. Biodiversity net gain aligns with environmental objectives, recognizing the crucial role of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem health and resilience while promoting sustainable economic development.&#x20;

### Biodiversity Offset&#x20;

a conservation or restoration action taken to compensate for the adverse impacts on biodiversity resulting from development or land use changes in one location. The purpose of a biodiversity offset is to achieve "no net loss" or even a "net gain" of biodiversity by ensuring that the negative effects of a project on ecosystems, species, or habitats are balanced by conservation efforts elsewhere. Biodiversity offsets typically involve the restoration, protection, or creation of habitats or ecosystems of similar ecological value to those affected by development. These offset measures aim to contribute to the overall conservation and sustainable management of biodiversity. Biodiversity offsets are often required by regulatory authorities to mitigate the environmental impact of development projects.

### Biome&#x20;

Global-scale zones, generally defined by the type of plant life that they support in response to average rainfall and temperature patterns e.g., tundra, coral reefs or savannas. _TNFD; IPBES_

### Bundling&#x20;

Bundling involves grouping multiple ecosystem services or benefits together into a unified package for valuation or compensation. This approach acknowledges the interconnectedness of different ecosystem services and assesses their collective value, rather than evaluating each service separately. Bundling recognizes the combined benefits provided by ecosystems and is used to support comprehensive ecosystem valuation and management. Bundling Example: Instead of valuing flood regulation, water purification, and habitat separately, a wetland ecosystem's combined benefits are assessed and compensated as a single package.

### Climate Adaptation&#x20;

Climate Adaptation is the process of adjusting to and preparing for the impacts of climate change. It involves developing strategies and implementing measures to reduce the vulnerability of individuals, communities, ecosystems, and infrastructure to climate-related risks. Climate adaptation aims to enhance resilience and ensure that societies can effectively respond to and recover from the changing climate. Adaptation efforts may include building resilient infrastructure, protecting natural ecosystems, implementing water management practices, and developing early warning systems to mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events and other climate-related challenges.&#x20;

### Climate Finance&#x20;

Climate Finance is the allocation of financial resources, investments, and funding mechanisms to support climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts at local, national, and global levels. It encompasses a diverse array of financial instruments, including public funds, private investments, grants, loans, and market-based mechanisms like carbon trading. Climate finance aims to address the challenges posed by climate change by funding projects and initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance climate resilience, and facilitate the transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy. It plays a critical role in supporting developing countries in their efforts to combat climate change and fulfill their climate-related commitments under international agreements such as the Paris Agreement. Climate finance is instrumental in advancing climate action and facilitating the transformation towards a more sustainable and climate-resilient future.&#x20;

### Climate Lease

Developed by Thomas Morgan, CCIM, the Climate Lease introduces a financial strategy from investment real estate to environmental conservation, leading to the innovation of [Ecological Ensurance](broken-reference). The climate lease, which has also been referred to as biodiversity lease, habitat lease, carbon lease, net zero lease, nature lease, conservation lease, and resilience lease, borrows from the global commercial real estate market the financial model that utilizes leasing instead of owning to enhance capital efficiency and minimize opportunity costs for conservation funders and entities dependent on ecosystem services. By leasing environmental assets funders can invest more projects, achieving better overall returns than if they were to allocate capital towards owning these assets. This leasing model provides the benefits of environmental stewardship without the upfront cost and financial burdens of ownership, encouraging investment in conservation. Ecological Ensurance is a derivative model of this that calculates the residual value of the real estate at zero which allows the land/property/ecosystem to go into permanent trust. Payments made under these long-term leases motivate real asset and income investors to support environmental projects, as they get market rate yields while knowing the land will ultimately be preserved in a trust. This ensures permanent protection for the leased ecosystems, offering a sustainable model for combining economic and environmental goals.

### Climate Mitigation&#x20;

Climate Mitigation is actions and strategies aimed at reducing or preventing the emission of greenhouse gases and other drivers of climate change. The primary goal of climate mitigation is to limit the extent of global warming and its associated impacts on the environment and human societies. Mitigation efforts encompass a wide range of activities, including transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, implementing sustainable land-use practices, and adopting policies to reduce emissions from industries and transportation. Climate mitigation is a critical component of global efforts to combat climate change and achieve international climate targets, such as those outlined in the Paris Agreement.&#x20;

### Climate Resilience&#x20;

Climate Resilience is the capacity of individuals, communities, ecosystems, and systems to withstand and adapt to the adverse effects of climate change while maintaining essential functions. It involves strategies and measures aimed at reducing vulnerability to climate-related risks, enhancing adaptive capabilities, and ensuring the ability to recover from climate impacts. Climate resilience is crucial for safeguarding human well-being, ecosystems, infrastructure, and economies in the face of a changing climate, including extreme weather events, rising temperatures, and sea-level rise.&#x20;

### Climate Sprint

A Climate Sprint is a focused, three-week initiative designed by John Sanchez, aimed at immersing participants in tangible climate projects. It encourages a deep dive into climate solutions through learning, engaging with stakeholders, and team brainstorming towards a specific goal. This structured program offers accountability, collaboration, and a short, impactful timeline for those looking to explore or deepen their involvement in the climate field. John Sanchez, a Harvard undergrad on a gap year dedicated to climate change efforts, founded Climate Sprints to facilitate a hands-on approach to addressing climate challenges.

### Co-benefits&#x20;

Co-benefits associated with carbon reduction efforts are the positive side effects that go beyond addressing climate change. These co-benefits touch various aspects of society and the environment. One of the most notable is improved air quality, as actions to reduce carbon emissions often lead to decreased levels of harmful pollutants, benefiting public health by reducing respiratory illnesses and healthcare costs. Additionally, such efforts often promote energy efficiency, resulting in lower energy consumption, cost savings, and enhanced energy security. The transition to a low-carbon economy can also create jobs, contributing to economic growth. Biodiversity and ecosystems benefit from carbon reduction measures by preserving habitats and reducing resource exploitation. Moreover, these actions enhance community resilience and social equity, ensuring that the advantages of carbon mitigation are shared broadly, especially among marginalized populations. Recognizing these co-benefits underscores the importance of comprehensive climate strategies that yield numerous positive outcomes for society and the environment.

### Co-Benefits Climate Sprint

In August 2021, the Climate Sprint focused on the valuation of long-term co-benefits and ecosystem services within climate finance. Participants were tasked with developing methods to identify, rate, and price the additional benefits of carbon projects. The teams worked on integrating these values into climate finance initiatives, aiming to align them with climate, financial, ESG, and impact goals. This Sprint covered areas such as carbon removal, climate adaptation, conservation, emissions reduction, energy transition, and climate justice, targeting a wide range of stakeholders. The final deliverables included a valuation system for co-benefits, a detailed project scope, and a pitch targeting potential investors or participants, designed to demonstrate the project's viability, scalability, and impact. Open to anyone with an interest in climate and conservation finance, the Sprint emphasized practical, scalable solutions for incorporating ecosystem services into climate projects. This Climate Sprint resulted in the Core Benefits Label.

### Core Benefits Label

Based on the [Co-Benefits Climate Sprint](glossary.md#co-benefits-climate-sprint), the Core Benefits Label aimed to make the valuation of ecosystem services and co-benefits in climate finance more understandable and actionable. It detailed efforts by a diverse team to value long-term co-benefits for net-zero companies and stakeholders through a "Climate Sprint" approach for rapid, collaborative development. The concept of a "Core Benefits Label," similar to nutrition labels, was proposed to assist investors in identifying climate projects with significant ecological and social impacts, aiming to improve how such projects are evaluated for their broader benefits beyond carbon reduction.

### ecotone

Ecotones are places where ecosystems grade into each other along a gradient in one or more resources or environmental controls. A typical example is the transition from forest to grassland on a gradient of moisture availability. The precise location of ecosystem types, and hence the ecotones between them is ultimately subjective. Where these gradients are very gentle, ecotones can occupy quite extensive areas. The translation of gradients and ecotones on ecosystem classification will depend on the nature and ‘sharpness’ of the transition, and the scale of application. _Source: SEEA EA_

### Half Earth

The "Half Earth" concept, proposed by biologist E.O. Wilson, suggests that to safeguard Earth's biodiversity and ecological health, we should set aside and protect at least half of the planet's terrestrial and marine ecosystems for conservation purposes. The idea is to designate these areas as protected reserves, free from significant human interference, to preserve a wide range of species and their habitats. By dedicating 50% of the Earth's land and oceans to conservation, the "Half Earth" concept aims to mitigate the ongoing loss of biodiversity, protect ecosystems, and ensure the long-term survival of countless species. This ambitious goal underscores the importance of prioritizing conservation efforts and adopting sustainable practices to address the interconnected challenges of biodiversity loss and habitat degradation.
