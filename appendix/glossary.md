Biodiversity credits aim to balance economic development with biodiversity preservation and are often used in regulatory frameworks like biodiversity offset programs.&#x20;

### Biodiversity Net Gain&#x20;

a conservation approach and policy framework applied to development and land-use planning. This concept mandates that development projects must not only avoid harming biodiversity but also result in a quantifiable increase in biodiversity and habitat quality compared to the pre-development state. Under this principle, developers and landowners are required to assess the biodiversity value of a site before commencing any development activities. Subsequently, they must implement measures to enhance or restore biodiversity, often through activities such as habitat creation and native vegetation planting. Biodiversity net gain aligns with environmental objectives, recognizing the crucial role of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem health and resilience while promoting sustainable economic development.&#x20;

### Biodiversity Offset&#x20;

a conservation or restoration action taken to compensate for the adverse impacts on biodiversity resulting from development or land use changes in one location. The purpose of a biodiversity offset is to achieve "no net loss" or even a "net gain" of biodiversity by ensuring that the negative effects of a project on ecosystems, species, or habitats are balanced by conservation efforts elsewhere. Biodiversity offsets typically involve the restoration, protection, or creation of habitats or ecosystems of similar ecological value to those affected by development. These offset measures aim to contribute to the overall conservation and sustainable management of biodiversity. Biodiversity offsets are often required by regulatory authorities to mitigate the environmental impact of development projects.

### Biome&#x20;

### Climate Lease

Developed by Thomas Morgan, CCIM, the Climate Lease introduces a financial strategy from investment real estate to environmental conservation, leading to the innovation of [Ecological Ensurance](broken-reference). The climate lease, which has also been referred to as biodiversity lease, habitat lease, carbon lease, net zero lease, nature lease, conservation lease, and resilience lease, borrows from the global commercial real estate market the financial model that utilizes leasing instead of owning to enhance capital efficiency and minimize opportunity costs for conservation funders and entities dependent on ecosystem services. By leasing environmental assets funders can invest more projects, achieving better overall returns than if they were to allocate capital towards owning these assets. This leasing model provides the benefits of environmental stewardship without the upfront cost and financial burdens of ownership, encouraging investment in conservation. Ecological Ensurance is a derivative model of this that calculates the residual value of the real estate at zero which allows the land/property/ecosystem to go into permanent trust. Payments made under these long-term leases motivate real asset and income investors to support environmental projects, as they get market rate yields while knowing the land will ultimately be preserved in a trust. This ensures permanent protection for the leased ecosystems, offering a sustainable model for combining economic and environmental goals.

### Climate Mitigation&#x20;
