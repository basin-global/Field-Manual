To ascertain the "RealValue" of Natural Capital, our investigation delves into various types of value and the valuation methods that have been adopted across different cultures and economies globally. We've considered the historical evolution of these value types, their current applications, and their potential utility in ecosystem restoration and conservation initiatives.

The concept of "value" is deeply embedded across multiple disciplines such as economics, philosophy, and social sciences, each offering different lenses through which to view worth or importance. In economics, the transition from labor theories to marginalist theory highlights the shifting understanding of value, from an objective measure to one that is more subjective and determined by individual preferences. Philosophical perspectives on value have been shaped by moral and ethical frameworks that assess the intrinsic qualities of ideas or actions. Sociocultural perspectives add another layer of complexity, often hinging on community or societal norms. Even in art and finance, value takes on multiple dimensions, be it aesthetic, emotional, or monetary.

Within the scope of real assets, natural capital, and ecosystem services, the notion of value gains even more facets. Modern interpretations now include environmental and social governance (ESG) metrics. Emerging markets like carbon credits and biodiversity credits, as well as the concept of "regenerative finance," continue to redefine what constitutes "value." Regenerative finance aims to align capital allocation with sustainable practices that not only maintain but also improve natural and social systems.

This appendix serves as an overview and foundation for understanding how these concepts interact with the sectors of real assets, natural capital, and ecosystem services. Our goal is to shed light on how different valuation methodologies can be applied or adapted to promote ecosystem restoration and conservation, aligning financial incentives with sustainable practices.
