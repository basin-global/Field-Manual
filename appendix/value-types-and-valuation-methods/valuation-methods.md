# Valuation Methods

In our exhaustive review of diverse resources, we pinpointed various valuation methods relevant to both real assets and ecosystem services valuation (ESV). While certain methods are tailored to one type of asset, a substantial number are versatile, finding utility in both realms.

We started by segregating these methods based on their applicability to either real assets or ESV. However it become clear and should be noted that **each discipline has invaluable lessons to impart to the other**. Specifically, **ESV stands to gain from adopting financial and economic valuation techniques prevalent in real asset assessments. In turn, the realm of real assets could benefit from embracing the qualitative and intrinsic valuation methodologies common in ESV**.

This mutual exchange of methods highlights a rich landscape for innovation, leading to more accurate and holistic valuations in both sectors.

## Valuation Methods Across Asset Types

Here are the valuation methods used across real-world use cases and literature we reviewed, ranked by the number (#) of frameworks that utilized each approach to value. The full list, by framework, is available in the accompanying RealValue workbook under the "[Valuation Methods](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQwj56Qg699KpORHt\_jm3YA43PAvEbwJuETykHpRhxM7YQ0ErbGIKcPZ0bc0a6R3mQlLx4rDGNTPCSy/pubhtml?gid=676632939\&single=true)" sheet.
