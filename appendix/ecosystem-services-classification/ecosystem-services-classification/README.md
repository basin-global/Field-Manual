# Ecosystem Services Classification

Our comparative analysis of the selected ecosystem services frameworks revealed a consistent set of 19 top-level ecosystem services that were commonly referenced and utilized across all studies. These frameworks varied in scope ranging between 10 to 27 key ecosystem services. The 19 services identified as consistent across all frameworks are:&#x20;

## Common Ecosystem Services Classes

| Raw Materials              | Food                              |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Energy                     | Water Security (supply & storage) |
| Soil                       | Medicinal & Genetic               |
| Climate Regulation         | Air Quality                       |
| Water Quality (filtration) | Hazard Risk Reduction             |
| Pollination                | Erosion Control                   |
| Biological Control         | Habitat                           |
| Recreation & Tourism       | Research & Education              |
| Aesthetic                  | Cultural & Spiritual              |
| Existence                  |                                   |

For each ecosystem service and corresponding framework, we have compiled the following information where available:

* Name Used
* Service Category (e.g., Provisioning, Supporting)
* Definition
* Economic Value Calculated
* Applicable Valuation Methods (e.g., Travel Cost, Hedonic Pricing, Contingent Valuation)
* Metrics for Quantitative and Qualitative Assessment

As the top level categories varied across frameworks, we have roughly sorted them by Provisioning, Regulating, and Cultural Services.
