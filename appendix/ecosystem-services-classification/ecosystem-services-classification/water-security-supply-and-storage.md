Name Used: Water flow regulation services

Service Category: Regulating

Definition: by sub-category

See Valuation Methods Appendix for Economic Value, Valuation Methods, and Metrics.



Name Used: Baseline Flow Maintenance Services

Definition: Water regulation services are the ecosystem contributions to the regulation of river flows and groundwater and lake water tables. They are derived from the ability of ecosystems to absorb and store water, and gradually release water during dry seasons or periods through evapotranspiration and hence secure a regular flow of water. This may be recorded as a final or intermediate ecosystem service.



Name Used: Peak Flow Mitigation Services

Definition: Water regulation services are the ecosystem contributions to the regulation of river flows and groundwater and lake water tables. They are derived from the ability of ecosystems to absorb and store water, and hence mitigate the effects of flood and other extreme water-related events. Peak flow mitigation services will be supplied together with river flood mitigation services in providing the benefit of flood protection. This is a final ecosystem service.

## CICES

Name Used: Surface Water Used for Nutrition, Materials or Energy

Service Category: Provisioning

Definition: Surface Water Used for Nutrition, Materials, or Energy encompasses the various applications of surface water resources, including freshwater and coastal or marine waters. When used for drinking, the water is quantified by its amount, type, and source. For material uses that don't include drinking, metrics involve the amount and source of the water. In the context of energy, freshwater surface water and coastal or marine water are both accounted for, measured by their amount, type, and source. This highlights the essential role of surface water in meeting diverse human needs, from sustenance and industrial applications to energy generation.

Name Used: Ground water used for Nutrition, Materials or Energy

Service Category: Provisioning

Definition: Ground Water Used for Nutrition, Materials, or Energy refers to the utilization of subterranean water reserves for various applications. This includes ground water used for drinking, quantified by the amount, type, and source; ground water used for material purposes other than drinking, measured by the amount and source; and ground water utilized as an energy source, also quantified by the amount and source. These categories reflect the versatile roles that ground water plays in meeting diverse human needs, from hydration and material production to energy generation.

Name Used: Regulation of Baseline Flows & Extreme Events

Service Category: Regulation and Maintenance

Definition: Regulation of Baseline Flows and Extreme Events refers to the ecosystem's role in controlling various environmental dynamics and reducing associated risks. This encompasses control of erosion rates, buffering and attenuation of mass movement, hydrological cycle and water flow regulation, as well as storm and fire protection—all of which are measured by metrics like risk reduction and the area protected. Additionally, the regulation extends to the management of mass, liquid, and gaseous flows, quantified by their respective types and amounts. Together, these functions contribute to the stability and resilience of ecosystems against both regular and extreme environmental events.

## FEMA ESV 2022

Name Used: Water Supply; Water Storage

Service Category: Provisioning

Definition: Regulating the rate of water flow through an environment and ensuring adequate water availability for all water users; Providing long-term reserves of usable water via storage - in lakes, ponds, aquifers, and soil moisture

Economic Value Calculated: Yes; No

Valuation Methods: Avoided Cost, Meta-Analysis, Replacement Cost, Market Value &#x20;

Metrics:&#x20;

Forest: Water Supply was calculated as a function of mean annual precipitation (1981–2010), mean annual discharge, reported water runoff and evapotranspiration, all spatially explicit and derived using geographic information system and other spatial interpolation models. The value of water supply was based on an average cost of alternative water sources, including groundwater extraction, desalinization and surface water collection and treatment.&#x20;

Inland Wetlands: Water Supply utilized function transfer—a type of benefit transfer method—to construct a United States–specific value from two meta-analyses on the economic value of wetlands in Value ($/ac/yr)

Riparian Water Supply: Zavaleta (2000) used multiple avoided cost calculations to arrive at an average value for the value of water supply provided by riparian areas.253 Utility market data was then used to monetize the amount of water stored in riparian areas, which, once released, would flow to a downstream dam where utility pumping infrastructure was located. Roberts and Leitch (1997) used the replacement cost and avoided cost methods to value the amount of water stored in wetland and lakeside riparian vegetation.254 The method incorporated the avoided costs of alternative water supply infrastructure, such as dams.
