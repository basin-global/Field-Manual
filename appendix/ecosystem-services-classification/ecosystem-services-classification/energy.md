# Energy

## SEEA EA

SEEA groups energy under Biomass provisioning services. We group Energy as a flow from Real Assets and thus have not separated out here.  Please see the Biomass provisioning services section in Raw Materials. Note from SEEA CF: \_While the SEEA Central Framework provides guidance on the valuation of renewable and non-renewable natural resources and land within the System of National Accounts (SNA) asset boundary, it does not include guidance on valuation methods on these assets and related flows that go beyond values already included in the SNA.\_&#x20;

## CICES

Name Used: Cultivated Aquatic Plants for Nutrition, Materials or Energy

Metrics: included in definition



Name Used: Cultivated Terrestrial Plants for Nutrition, Materials or Energy

Service Category: Provisioning

Definition: the intentional growth of terrestrial plants, fungi, and algae for various applications. These include nutritional purposes, where crops are classified by amount and type such as cereals or soft fruits; material purposes, where fibers and other materials are categorized by amount, type, use, and media like land or freshwater; and energy production, quantified by the amount and type of biomass produced. These cultivated plants serve as essential resources, each measured by specific metrics to assess their respective contributions.

Name Used: Reared Animals For Nutrition, Materials or Energy

Service Category: Provisioning

Definition: Reared Animals for Nutrition, Materials, or Energy refers to the practice of raising animals for various purposes, including food, materials, and energy production. When reared for nutrition, animals and their by-products are quantified by amount and type, such as beef or dairy. For material purposes, fibers and other materials obtained from these animals are measured by amount, type, use, and the media they are derived from, such as land or water. Animals reared for energy, including mechanical energy, are also categorized and quantified by amount, type, and source. These practices underscore the multi-faceted contributions that reared animals make to human society and various industries.

Name Used: Reared Aquatic Animals for Nutrition, Materials or Energy

Service Category: Provisioning

Definition: Reared Aquatic Animals for Nutrition, Materials, or Energy refers to the cultivation of aquatic animals through in-situ aquaculture for various end-uses. When raised for nutritional purposes, these animals are quantified by amount and type. For material applications, excluding genetic materials, the same metrics of amount and type are used. Animals reared as an energy source are also categorized and measured by amount and type. This illustrates the multiple roles that aquacultured animals serve, from providing food and materials to acting as a source of energy.

Name Used: Surface Water Used for Nutrition, Materials or Energy

Service Category: Provisioning

Definition: Surface Water Used for Nutrition, Materials, or Energy encompasses the various applications of surface water resources, including freshwater and coastal or marine waters. When used for drinking, the water is quantified by its amount, type, and source. For material uses that don't include drinking, metrics involve the amount and source of the water. In the context of energy, freshwater surface water and coastal or marine water are both accounted for, measured by their amount, type, and source. This highlights the essential role of surface water in meeting diverse human needs, from sustenance and industrial applications to energy generation.

Name Used: Ground water used for Nutrition, Materials or Energy

Service Category: Provisioning

Definition: Ground Water Used for Nutrition, Materials, or Energy refers to the utilization of subterranean water reserves for various applications. This includes ground water used for drinking, quantified by the amount, type, and source; ground water used for material purposes other than drinking, measured by the amount and source; and ground water utilized as an energy source, also quantified by the amount and source. These categories reflect the versatile roles that ground water plays in meeting diverse human needs, from hydration and material production to energy generation.

## InVEST

Name Used: Offshore Wind Energy

Service Category: Renewable Energy

Definition: The InVEST Offshore Wind Energy model measures the electricity generation potential of wind over ocean and large lake surfaces. It estimates expected wind power and harvested energy for a chosen region and calculates the levelized cost of energy and the net present value of constructing and operating a wind energy facility.

Economic Value Calculated: Yes

Valuation Methods: Net Present Value, Levelized Cost of Energy

Metrics: Wind power potential, energy generation, offset carbon emissions, net present value, and levelized cost of energy, all given at the farm level. Spatial maps are used for detailed analysis, and users are allowed to select the number of turbines for the farm. &#x20;

Name Used: Reservoir Hydropower Production (Water Yield) &#x20;

Service Category: Renewable Energy/Water Management &#x20;

Definition: The InVEST Reservoir Hydropower Production model estimates the annual average quantity of water produced by a watershed and its economic value for reservoir hydropower production. It calculates the relative contribution of each land parcel to annual average water yield and hydropower production, valuing this in terms of energy production and calculating the net present value over the reservoir's lifetime. &#x20;

Economic Value Calculated: Yes &#x20;

Valuation Methods: Net Present Value of hydropower production over the life of the reservoir &#x20;

Metrics: Annual average water yield, energy production, net present value of hydropower production. Spatially-explicit outputs of relative water yields help identify areas contributing the most to hydropower value. The model also considers changes in landscape that affect water yield and subsequently hydropower production capacity.  &#x20;
