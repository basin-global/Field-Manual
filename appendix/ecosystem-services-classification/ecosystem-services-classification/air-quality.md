# Air Quality

## SEEA EA

Name Used: Air Filtration Services &#x20;

Service Category: Regulating and maintenance services

Definition: The ecosystem contributions to the filtering of air-borne pollutants through the deposition, uptake, fixing, and storage of pollutants by ecosystem components, particularly plants, that mitigates the harmful effects of the pollutants. This is most commonly a final ecosystem service. &#x20;

See Valuation Methods Appendix for Economic Value, Valuation Methods, and Metrics.

## CICES

Name Used: Atmospheric Composition & Conditions

Service Category: Regulation and Maintenance

Definition: Atmospheric Composition and Conditions refers to the role of living systems in regulating the chemical composition of the atmosphere as well as temperature and humidity. This includes the regulation of atmospheric chemicals, measured by the contribution of specific types of living systems to the amounts or concentrations of these chemicals. Similarly, the control of temperature and humidity, including processes like ventilation and transpiration, is also governed by living systems and is quantified by their contributions to specific climatic parameters. These functions highlight the integral role that ecosystems play in maintaining the stability and balance of atmospheric conditions, crucial for both environmental health and human well-being.

Name Used: Mediation of Nuisances of Anthropogenic Origin

Service Category: Regulation and Maintenance

Definition: Mediation of Nuisances of Anthropogenic Origin encompasses the natural mechanisms that mitigate nuisances caused by human activities. This includes smell reduction, noise attenuation, and visual screening, each regulated by different types of living systems such as specific plant or animal communities. These functions are measured by the type of living system involved in the mediation process. Additionally, the category includes abiotic structures or processes that also serve to mitigate nuisances, quantified by their types and amounts. Together, these biotic and abiotic elements work to alleviate the impact of human-generated nuisances on the environment and improve the quality of life.

Forests: The effects of forests on air quality in various U.S. locations were assessed through multiple studies by Nowak et al. In a 2013 study, the impact of forests on fine particulate matter less than 2.5 microns was analyzed in 10 U.S. cities. This was monetized based on the avoided human mortality and morbidity costs, with values originally estimated in 2010 USD per square meter per year of tree cover, later converted to 2021 USD per acre per year. Similarly, a 2006 study examined how forests contribute to the removal of five different pollutants—O3, PM10, NO2, SO2, and CO—in 55 cities. The value of these effects was quantified using monetized externality values that reflect societal costs of pollution, initially reported in 1994 USD and converted to 2021 figures. A 2014 study expanded on this to include both urban and rural forest impacts on air pollution removal across the conterminous U.S., also converting original 2010 USD figures to 2021 USD per acre per year. In both the 2013 and 2014 studies, dollar values for pollution reduction were sourced from the EPA, based on the agency's primary air quality standards.

Urban Green Open Space: Gopalakrishnan et al.'s 2018 study and two local studies by the Trust for Public Land uniquely focus on the human health benefits derived from the pollution-removal capacity of vegetated areas. Utilizing the i-Tree Eco model and the EPA's BenMAP program, these studies explore the health impacts of various pollutants including ozone, nitrogen oxides, and particulates in several U.S. urban areas. An avoided cost approach is employed to quantify the value of these benefits, considering factors such as reduced respiratory illness, fewer emergency room visits, and lower hospital admission rates. The studies use the Leaf Area Index, percentage of land cover, and local air pollution data to assess the vegetation's impact on health. Economically, they follow a "cost-of-illness" method, factoring in expenses related to healthcare and loss of school days. &#x20;

Riparian: Riparian areas contribute to air quality by filtering pollutants such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone, among others. This value is calculated as an average of the benefits provided by forests and green open spaces. All methodologies in the cited studies employ an avoidance cost approach, factoring in the healthcare costs saved from reduced pollution-related illnesses. The absorption rates of pollutants are monetized based on market prices for alternative air purification methods. The benefits tend to be more significant in urban settings, and a more detailed breakdown comparing urban and rural areas could further refine the economic valuation of riparian zones for air quality.
