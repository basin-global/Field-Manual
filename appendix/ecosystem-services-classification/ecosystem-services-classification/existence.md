# Existence

## SEEA EA

Name Used: Ecosystem and Species Appreciation &#x20;

Service Category: Flows related to non-use values&#x20;

Definition: Ecosystem and species appreciation concerns the well-being that people derive from the existence and preservation of the environment for current and future generations, irrespective of any direct or indirect use. This is most commonly associated with non-use values.

See Valuation Methods Appendix for Economic Value, Valuation Methods, and Metrics.

## CICES

Name Used: Other Characteristics That Have a Non-Use Value

Service Category: Cultural

Definition: Other Biotic or Abiotic Characteristics that Have a Non-Use Value refers to the inherent worth of natural elements, irrespective of their utility for human activities. This includes characteristics or features of living systems with existence value, meaning they are valued simply for their presence, and those with bequest value, implying they are valued for their potential significance to future generations. Both are quantified by the type of living system or environmental setting. The category also includes natural, abiotic features that hold either existence or bequest values, measured by their types and amounts. These non-use values emphasize the intrinsic importance of preserving and respecting the natural environment, beyond its immediate practical applications.

Economic Value Calculated: No

Valuation Methods: n/a

## FEMA ESV 2022

Name Used: Existence Value

Service Category: Information

Definition: Well-being gained by the knowledge that an environmental resource exists, even without on-site use of that resource

Economic Value Calculated: Yes

Valuation Methods: Replacement Cost, Meta-Analysis

Metrics: Nowak et al. (2002) approached the valuation of trees through the lens of their existence value, estimating this value based on replacement costs in eight different cities. Using field data and the valuation methods outlined by the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers, they assessed trees as structural assets to determine compensatory values for entire tree populations. The values were initially estimated in terms of 2001 USD per square meter over the life span of a tree. These were later converted to a per-acre basis and divided by the average life span of trees to arrive at annual values. Finally, these annualized values were adjusted to 2021 USD per acre per year for standardized comparison.
