Name Used: Reared Animals For Nutrition, Materials or Energy

Service Category: Provisioning

Definition: Reared Animals for Nutrition, Materials, or Energy refers to the practice of raising animals for various purposes, including food, materials, and energy production. When reared for nutrition, animals and their by-products are quantified by amount and type, such as beef or dairy. For material purposes, fibers and other materials obtained from these animals are measured by amount, type, use, and the media they are derived from, such as land or water. Animals reared for energy, including mechanical energy, are also categorized and quantified by amount, type, and source. These practices underscore the multi-faceted contributions that reared animals make to human society and various industries.

Name Used: Reared Aquatic Animals for Nutrition, Materials or Energy

Service Category: Provisioning

Definition: Reared Aquatic Animals for Nutrition, Materials, or Energy refers to the cultivation of aquatic animals through in-situ aquaculture for various end-uses. When raised for nutritional purposes, these animals are quantified by amount and type. For material applications, excluding genetic materials, the same metrics of amount and type are used. Animals reared as an energy source are also categorized and measured by amount and type. This illustrates the multiple roles that aquacultured animals serve, from providing food and materials to acting as a source of energy.

Name Used: Surface Water Used for Nutrition, Materials or Energy

Service Category: Provisioning

Definition: Surface Water Used for Nutrition, Materials, or Energy encompasses the various applications of surface water resources, including freshwater and coastal or marine waters. When used for drinking, the water is quantified by its amount, type, and source. For material uses that don't include drinking, metrics involve the amount and source of the water. In the context of energy, freshwater surface water and coastal or marine water are both accounted for, measured by their amount, type, and source. This highlights the essential role of surface water in meeting diverse human needs, from sustenance and industrial applications to energy generation.

## InVEST

Name Used: Crop Production

Service Category: Agriculture/Nutrition &#x20;

Definition: The InVEST Crop Production models estimate crop yield and nutrient value for a fixed set of crops, using user-supplied landcover information. The models consider the impact of climate and optionally fertilizer rates to evaluate crop yield. The aim is to explore the economic and nutritional benefits of different cropping systems while also assessing their impact on ecosystem services. &#x20;

Economic Value Calculated: Yes &#x20;

Valuation Methods: Estimates of crop yield, comparison of economic returns for different cropping systems &#x20;

Metrics: Crop yield per hectare, nutritional information for 33 macro and micronutrients, quality control via observed results from the same region. The Percentile Model covers 175 crops worldwide, listing yields for the 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles in each of the crop's climate bins. The Regression Model focuses on 10 staple crops and requires additional data on fertilizer application rates.  &#x20;

## Swiss Re BES Index
