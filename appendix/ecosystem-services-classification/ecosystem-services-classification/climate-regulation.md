# Climate Regulation

## SEEA EA

Name Used: Global Climate Regulation Services &#x20;

Service Category: Regulating and maintenance services

Definition: The ecosystem contributions to reducing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere through the removal (sequestration) of carbon from the atmosphere and the retention (storage) of carbon in ecosystems. These services support the regulation of the chemical composition of the atmosphere and oceans. This is a final ecosystem service.

See Valuation Methods Appendix for Economic Value, Valuation Methods, and Metrics.\


Name Used: Local (Micro and Meso) Climate Regulation Services &#x20;

Service Category: Regulating and maintenance services

Definition: The ecosystem contributions to the regulation of ambient atmospheric conditions, including micro and mesoscale climates, through the presence of vegetation that improves living conditions for people and supports economic production. Examples include the evaporative cooling provided by urban trees ('green space'), the role of urban water bodies ('blue space'), and the contribution of trees in providing shade for humans and livestock. This may be a final or intermediate service.

See Valuation Methods Appendix for Economic Value, Valuation Methods, and Metrics.



Name Used: Rainfall pattern regulation services (at sub- continental scale)

Service Category: Regulating and maintenance services &#x20;

Definition: Rainfall pattern regulation services are the ecosystem contributions of vegetation, in particular forests, in maintaining rainfall patterns through evapotranspiration at the sub-continental scale. Forests and other vegetation recycle moisture back to the atmosphere where it is available for the generation of rainfall. Rainfall in interior parts of continents fully depends upon this recycling. This may be a final or intermediate service. &#x20;

## CICES

Name Used: Atmospheric Composition & Conditions

Service Category: Regulation and Maintenance

Definition: Atmospheric Composition and Conditions refers to the role of living systems in regulating the chemical composition of the atmosphere as well as temperature and humidity. This includes the regulation of atmospheric chemicals, measured by the contribution of specific types of living systems to the amounts or concentrations of these chemicals. Similarly, the control of temperature and humidity, including processes like ventilation and transpiration, is also governed by living systems and is quantified by their contributions to specific climatic parameters. These functions highlight the integral role that ecosystems play in maintaining the stability and balance of atmospheric conditions, crucial for both environmental health and human well-being.

Name Used: Regulation of Baseline Flows & Extreme Events

Service Category: Regulation and Maintenance

Definition: Regulation of Baseline Flows and Extreme Events refers to the ecosystem's role in controlling various environmental dynamics and reducing associated risks. This encompasses control of erosion rates, buffering and attenuation of mass movement, hydrological cycle and water flow regulation, as well as storm and fire protection—all of which are measured by metrics like risk reduction and the area protected. Additionally, the regulation extends to the management of mass, liquid, and gaseous flows, quantified by their respective types and amounts. Together, these functions contribute to the stability and resilience of ecosystems against both regular and extreme environmental events.

Name Used: Climate Regulation

Service Category: Regulating

Definition: Supporting a stable climate at global and local levels through carbon sequestration and other processes&#x20;

Economic Value Calculated: Yes

Valuation Methods: Avoided Cost &#x20;

Metrics:&#x20;

Forests: For calculating the carbon sequestration metrics of forests, coastal wetlands, , an extensive database containing over 6,000 individual carbon values was consulted. From this, four key studies comprising 717 specific carbon sequestration values were selected to construct an average value estimate per acre per year. The valuation was then carried out using the social cost of carbon (SCC), which accounts for the societal impacts of each additional metric ton of carbon emissions, measured in CO2 equivalent (CO2e). The SCC rates are updated by the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases and, for this study, the 2020 rate of $51 per metric ton CO2e was used, translating to $195.81 per metric ton of carbon in 2021 USD.&#x20;

Coastal Wetlands: Carbon sequestration in U.S. coastal wetlands was evaluated using a two-step approach. First, an aggregate database containing over 6,000 carbon values was tapped to estimate average carbon sequestration rates per acre per year, selecting five studies that collectively included 72 individual values. Next, the social cost of carbon (SCC) was applied to attach a dollar value to the sequestration rates. SCC measures the societal costs of each additional metric ton of carbon emissions (CO2e), covering aspects such as agricultural loss, health impacts, and increased disaster risk. It is regularly updated by the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases, based on Executive Order 13990.53. For this study, the 2020 SCC rate of $51 per metric ton CO2e was used, equivalent to $195.81 per metric ton of carbon in 2021 USD.

Inland Wetlands, Riparian, Urban Green Open Space, Rural Green Open Space used the same methodology above but with different studies.
