## SEEA EA

Name Used: Education, Scientific and Research Services &#x20;

Service Category: Cultural Services &#x20;

Definition: Education, scientific and research services are the ecosystem contributions, in particular through the biophysical characteristics and qualities of ecosystems, that enable people to use the environment through intellectual interactions with the environment. This is a final ecosystem service.

See Valuation Methods Appendix for Economic Value, Valuation Methods, and Metrics.

## CICES

Name Used: Intellectual & Representative Interactions with Natural Environment

Service Category: Cultural

Definition: Intellectual and Representative Interactions with Natural Environment refer to the varied ways in which the natural world serves as a subject or platform for intellectual pursuits, cultural expression, and aesthetic experiences. This includes characteristics of living systems that facilitate scientific investigation or the generation of traditional ecological knowledge, as well as those that enable education and training. Both are quantified by the type of living system or environmental setting involved. Additionally, characteristics resonant in terms of culture, heritage, or aesthetics are also included, measured by the same metrics. Natural abiotic features that enable intellectual interactions are quantified by their types and amounts. Collectively, these elements illustrate how the natural environment is not just a resource for material use but also a rich source for intellectual and cultural enrichment.

## FEMA ESV 2022

Name Used: Research and Education

Service Category: Information

Definition: Using natural systems for education and scientific research

Economic Value Calculated: Yes

Valuation Methods: Meta-Analysis

Metrics:&#x20;

Coral Reefs: The study by Brander and van Beukering (2013) used a function transfer method to create a generalized national estimate of coral reef value in the U.S. The model had 69 observations and an adjusted R^2 of 0.44. Variables like average U.S. GDP per capita and regional coral cover were considered. Specifically, the model focused on "research" as the primary ecosystem service variable. The value was initially in 2007 USD per hectare per year but was updated to 2021 USD per acre per year for relevance.
