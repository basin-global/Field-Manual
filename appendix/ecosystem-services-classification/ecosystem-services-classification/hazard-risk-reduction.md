## CICES

Name Used: Regulation of Baseline Flows & Extreme Events

Service Category: Regulation and Maintenance

Definition: Regulation of Baseline Flows and Extreme Events refers to the ecosystem's role in controlling various environmental dynamics and reducing associated risks. This encompasses control of erosion rates, buffering and attenuation of mass movement, hydrological cycle and water flow regulation, as well as storm and fire protectionâ€”all of which are measured by metrics like risk reduction and the area protected. Additionally, the regulation extends to the management of mass, liquid, and gaseous flows, quantified by their respective types and amounts. Together, these functions contribute to the stability and resilience of ecosystems against both regular and extreme environmental events.

Name Used: Mediation of Nuisances of Anthropogenic Origin

Service Category: Regulation and Maintenance

Definition: Mediation of Nuisances of Anthropogenic Origin encompasses the natural mechanisms that mitigate nuisances caused by human activities.

These functions are measured by the type of living system involved in the mediation process. Additionally, the category includes abiotic structures or processes that also serve to mitigate nuisances, quantified by their types and amounts. Together, these biotic and abiotic elements work to alleviate the impact of human-generated nuisances on the environment and improve the quality of life.

## FEMA ESV 2022

Name Used: Hazard Risk Reduction

Service Category: Regulating

Definition: Preventing and mitigating natural hazards such as floods, hurricanes, fires, and droughts

Economic Value Calculated: Yes

Valuation Methods: Avoided Cost, Alternative Cost, Meta-Analysis &#x20;

Metrics: &#x20;

Forest: McPherson and colleagues conducted multiple studies to assess the benefits of urban trees and small forests in stormwater flood mitigation, covering locations like Modesto and other cities in California. The original findings were reported in yearly values per city and in varying years' USD. These were then standardized by dividing by the total acreage of tree cover and converted to 2021 USD/acre/year. Wilson (2008) also evaluated the flood hazard reduction benefits of forests at a landscape scale using CITYgreen software. The original findings were in 2005 Canadian dollars per hectare per year and were likewise converted to 2021 USD/acre/year. &#x20;

Coastal Wetland: Sun and Carson (2020) studied the economic impact of tropical storms on U.S. coastal areas, focusing on the role of wetlands in reducing storm hazard risks. The study covered 237 coastal counties and presented median values in 2016 USD/sq km/year, which were then converted and inflated to 2021 USD/acre/year. To derive a U.S.-specific valuation for wetlands, a function transfer method was applied, drawing from multiple meta-analyses including Adusumilli (2015), Brander et al. (2006), Ghermandi et al. (2010), and Woodward & Wui (2001). Specific variables were set to highlight the role of coastal wetlands and their contribution to flood or storm hazard risk reduction. Income per capita, wetland size, and GDP per capita were among the variables adapted to U.S. specific data. All these values were eventually converted to 2021 USD per acre per year.

Inland Wetlands: A function transfer method was used to tailor U.S.-specific wetland values based on meta-analyses by Adusumilli (2015), Brander et al. (2006), Ghermandi et al. (2010), and Woodward & Wui (2001). The focus was on freshwater or inland wetlands and their role in flood and storm hazard risk reduction. Variables like income per capita, wetland size, and GDP per capita were set to U.S. specific metrics. The "publish" variable for the Woodward and Wui (2001) study was set to 1, ensuring the results were based on published values. All the dependent variables, initially in various units and years, were standardized to 2021 USD per acre per year.

Urban Green Open Space: The Trust for Public Land employed avoided cost methodology to assess the economic value of urban parks and open spaces in mitigating stormwater runoff. Using a model developed by the Western Research Station of the U.S. Forest Service, these studies leveraged geospatial land cover data and U.S. weather data on rainfall. The goal was to compare the water retention capacity of current land use versus that of a fully developed reference area. By correlating this information with water treatment data, the studies estimated cost-savings for city governments in terms of stormwater management.

Riparian:  Rein (1999) analyzed the role of riparian buffers along rivers as temporary flood storage areas, particularly focusing on the Pajaro River near Elkhorn Slough. Using economic data from flood events in 1995 and 1998, Rein calculated the avoided future flood costs that could be achieved through installing these buffers. Similarly, Kousky & Walls (2013) used Hazus flood modeling software to estimate the avoided flood damages due to the conservation of riparian lands. Watson et al. (2016) went further by mapping flood extents for 10 real-life flood events and computing the damages that upstream riparian areas could potentially mitigate. &#x20;

Coral Reefs: The study by Storlazzi et al. (2019) provided a comprehensive U.S.-wide estimate for the value of coral reefs in reducing storm hazard risks. The study was unique in its rigor, covering all U.S. areas and territories with associated coral reefs. The authors used high-resolution spatial and hydrodynamic modeling techniques similar to those employed by FEMA. Notably, the study considered both the value of at-risk infrastructure and the potential impacts to local economic activities, a factor often omitted in green infrastructure valuation. The methodology combined engineering, ecologic, geospatial, and economic modeling to quantify the coastal protection benefits of coral reefs across the U.S. and its territories.
