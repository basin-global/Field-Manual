Name Used: Spiritual, Symbolic & Other Interactions with Natural Environment

Service Category: Cultural

Definition: Spiritual, Symbolic, and Other Interactions with Natural Environment covers the diverse ways in which humans engage with the natural world for non-materialistic benefits. This includes elements of living systems that hold symbolic, sacred, or religious meanings, each quantified by the type of living system or environmental setting involved. It also extends to elements used for entertainment or representation. Additionally, the category encompasses natural, abiotic features of the environment that facilitate such interactions, measured by their types and amounts. Together, these aspects underscore the intangible yet significant value that the natural environment holds for human well-being and cultural richness.

Definition: Intellectual and Representative Interactions with Natural Environment refer to the varied ways in which the natural world serves as a subject or platform for intellectual pursuits, cultural expression, and aesthetic experiences. This includes characteristics of living systems that facilitate scientific investigation or the generation of traditional ecological knowledge, as well as those that enable education and training. Both are quantified by the type of living system or environmental setting involved. Additionally, characteristics resonant in terms of culture, heritage, or aesthetics are also included, measured by the same metrics. Natural abiotic features that enable intellectual interactions are quantified by their types and amounts. Collectively, these elements illustrate how the natural environment is not just a resource for material use but also a rich source for intellectual and cultural enrichment.
