The Ecosystem Services Valuation Database (ESVD) aims to support informed decision-making in ecosystem management by providing robust, monetized data on the economic benefits and costs of ecosystems and biodiversity. The database currently holds 9,500 value records from more than 1,100 studies, covering various biomes and geographic regions. By presenting these values in monetary terms, the ESVD helps internalize the significance of nature in policy and management decisions.
