# IPBES Global Assessment of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (NCP)

The **IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services** highlights the urgent decline of nature and its vital contributions to humanity, categorized as **Nature's Contributions to People (NCP)**. The report emphasizes that human activities, driven by various socio-economic factors, have significantly altered 75% of Earth's land, leading to biodiversity loss and diminished ecosystem functions. Despite this, nature remains essential for achieving Sustainable Development Goals. A transformational change is needed, involving systemic shifts in how we value and interact with nature. This change must consider not just stocks—current conditions of biodiversity and ecosystems—but also flows, the dynamic processes that maintain these systems, often guided by international governance such as the UN framework. The report argues that sustainable, equitable solutions are still attainable, but require immediate, concerted efforts.
