# TNFD Environmental Assets & Ecosystem Services

Source: Recommendations of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) [September 2023](https://tnfd.global/publication/recommendations-of-the-taskforce-on-nature-related-financial-disclosures/)

The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Recommendations outline requirements and best practices for disclosing nature-related financial data. Focused on four pillars—governance, strategy, risk and impact management, and metrics and targets—the document offers 14 specific disclosures. It emphasizes the crucial role of nature's health in business and finance and aims to help organizations integrate these considerations into decision-making and risk management.

{% hint style="warning" %}
TNFD appears to utilize and combine both SEEA - EA and IUCN GET 2.0 as well as other additions such as "Land".  Further clarification is needed from TNFD as to their methodology.
