# Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services(CICES) V5.1

Source: [CICES](https://cices.eu/)

The updated Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) Version 5.1 aims to better classify ecosystem contributions to human well-being. Developed through extensive consultations and compatible with its predecessor, V4.3, the new version refines definitions and includes both biotic and abiotic aspects of ecosystems. It maintains its hierarchical structure to categorize services into provisioning, regulation, and cultural benefits. Importantly, CICES V5.1 is designed not only to classify ecosystem services but also to serve as a reference framework that allows for translation between different ecosystem service classification systems, such as the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) and The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB).
