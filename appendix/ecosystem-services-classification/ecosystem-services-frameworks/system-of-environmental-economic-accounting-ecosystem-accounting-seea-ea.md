{% hint style="info" %}
“_The SEEA EA provides a reference list of ecosystem services including 33 main ecosystem services and agreed labels and descriptions. This reference list will support the development of methods, the sharing of knowledge and experience and the comparison of estimates of ecosystem services. The reference list was developed in collaboration with experts who have led the development of a range of ecosystem service classifications and typologies including CICES, NESCS, TEEB and IPBES-NCP._” - UN

The SEEA EA, developed under UN guidance, is a statistical framework that integrates both economic and biophysical data to better assess and value ecosystem services and human impacts on the environment. The framework applies the accounting principles of the 2008 SNA to harmonize environmental and economic data, facilitating more informed decision-making in both domains. It provides a comprehensive view of the relationship between the environment and the economy, complementing the SEEA Central Framework. One of its key features is the accounting structure that includes both stocks and flows, allowing for an integrated, coherent, and consistent set of data. This approach aims for regular and comparable measurements over time.

## Ecosystem Services Categories
