# Ecological Ensurance

Ecological Ensurance, by BASIN, ensures that the [RealValue of Natural Capital](../realvalue/the-realvalue-of-natural-capital/) is protected and stewarded in perpetuity.&#x20;

Unlike traditional insurance, which is retroactive, Ensurance is proactive, focusing on the preservation and restoration of ecosystems from the outset. It involves issuing Ensurance Policies and Certificates of Ensurance based on the RealValue of Natural Capital stocks and flows within specific ecological polygons.

This system allows for the calculation of Ensurance Premiums, guiding the path to permanent ecosystem protection, with roles defined for ENSURANCE Underwriters, ENSURERs, and ENSURANCE Agents. The innovative and progressive model also considers the ENSURED—the ecosystems and species themselves, alongside human and societal beneficiaries—ensuring a holistic approach to environmental conservation.

Ensurance protects ecosystems from day one while providing a definitive path to permanent protection, and restoration and stewardship funding. Ensurance Policies and Certificates of Ensurance are issued as part of the BASIN Protocol.

## Key components of ECOLOGICAL ENSURANCE by BASIN

### ENSURANCE

Ensures that ecosystems and the benefits they provide will permanently be protected and stewarded.

\##ENSURANCE Policy the specifications of the ensurance coverage, cost, and length.

### ENSURANCE Premium

\
Is the annual cost of ENSURANCE. The premium is calculated based off of the relationship between the annual RealValue, capital providers, and the underlying real asset cost/value. This relationship calculates cost options to put the ecosystem ENTRUST either today, 2030, 2040, or 2050. ENSURANCE Premiums can also be set based off a custom # of years. There is also a minimum premium amount which is the lowest cost but only protects the ecosystem year by year, not permanently.

### ENSURANCE Underwriter

Is responsible for evaluating and deciding the risk of ensuring ecological polygons, determining policy terms, setting premium prices, working with ENSURERs, ENSURANCE Agents and the ENSURED.

### ENSURER

aka ensurance carrier, the ENSURER issues the ensurance policy, bearing the risk in exchange for ensurance premiums paid by the ensured. ENSURER’s are BASIN Members that are either market rate investors, philanthropic funders, or blended finance vehicles.

### ENSURANCE Agents

Members of the BASIN Protocol who are seeking to fund their own nature and climate projects or help others fund their projects. ENSURANCE Agents help source and underwrite ensurance polices and sell Certificates of ENSURANCE.

### Certificates of ENSURANCE&#x20;

Are issued as part of the BASIN Protocol based on ENSURANCE Premium calculations.

### ENSURED

Unique to ensurance, this is the ecosystem and species themselves, the land owner, neighbors, the region, and society as a whole, as ensurance protects both anthropocentric and public goods values. The BASIN Protocol is the payment mechanism by and for the ENSURED.

### ENTRUST

Once the the ENSURANCE Premium has been paid in full and the ENSURANCE Policy has ended, the land/ecosystem goes into permanent trust.
