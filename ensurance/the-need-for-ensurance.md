# ‼ The need for Ensurance

These two quotes express the contradiction we currently face:

“How can you buy or sell the sky, the warmth of the land? The idea is strange to us. If we do not own the freshness of the air and the sparkle of the water, how can you buy them from us?”&#x20;

\-1854, Chief Seattle to the US Government

“Buy land, they're not making it anymore.”&#x20;

\-Mark Twain
