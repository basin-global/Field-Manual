# âš¡ Critical Infrastructure

Society, and the economy, is 100% dependent on Nature. All well-being is directly tied to the health of our collective, deeply interconnected, ecological systems.

Nature, biodiversity, and people are the critical infrastructure of our world.&#x20;

Ecological Ensurance by BASIN **ensures** the protection and regeneration of this critical infrastructure.
