# What You Seek

After all of our own [seeking](broken-reference), it would be easy to say that what we are after is [sustainable well-being](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781003173717/addicted-growth-robert-costanza) or [inclusive wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusive\_wealth).

But, it seems, there is something more to this.&#x20;

Maybe what we are after is regenerative wealth?

## Regenerative Wealth

Sustainability focuses on maintaining and preserving our current conditions to prevent future harm. **Regenerative**, however, take a proactive step further by actively enhancing and revitalizing systems, aiming to boost their health and vitality.

Historically, "**wealth**" signified well-being, health, happiness, prosperity, and preservation. Financial gains were considered a secondary outcome. For us, real wealth is embodied by flourishing ecological systems, inherently encompassing human health and well-being.

Ah, yes, that’s what we are after: **Regenerative Wealth**.
